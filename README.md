# python-code-for-statistical-testing-using-hypotheses-and-proportion
Given code test the hypotheses and proportion from the dataset using python
Consider it as a population dataset. Consider the variables x1=Gender, x2=Age, x3=Estimated cost of Ad and x4=1 [if ad is purchased] x4=0 [if ad is not purchased].
Compute population means of ages of males and females. Compute population variances of ages of males and females.
proportion of males whose ads were purchased and not purchased.[p1 and q1]
proportion of females whose ads were purchased and not purchased. [p2 and q2]
Take a random sample of at least 30 males and 30 females. Sample size can be equal or unequal as per proportion of males and females in the population. Please justify it accordingly; why equal or why unequal sample sizes are taken?
Test the following hypotheses: [ Use both critical value and p-value approach]
the proportion of males whose ads were purchased are equal to the proportion of females whose ads were purchased.
the Proportion of males whose ads were not purchased are equal to the proportion of females whose ads were not purchased.
The equality of variances of ages of males and females.
Based on the results of ‘c’, the equality of means of ages of males and females.
Construct Confidence Intervals for ‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’ and ‘d’ supporting the hypotheses conclusions.
Prepare a brief summary of the above analysis.
